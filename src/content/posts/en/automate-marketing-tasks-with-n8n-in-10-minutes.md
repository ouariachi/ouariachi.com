In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, automating repetitive tasks can save valuable time and resources. n8n, an extendable workflow automation tool, allows you to do just that without complex coding. In this article, we will explore how to set up three essential automation workflows using n8n in less than 10 minutes each. These workflows include automatically capturing leads from a web form, sending welcome emails, and sending notifications via Slack or Telegram.

## Getting Started with n8n

Before diving into specific workflows, make sure you have n8n set up. You can run n8n locally or through cloud services. For simplicity, this guide assumes you have a basic understanding of n8nâ€™s interface and node setup.

## 1. Automatic Lead Capture from a Web Form

**Goal:** Automatically capture data from a web form submission into a CRM or Google Sheets.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Trigger Node:** Use a Webhook node to listen for form submissions. Generate a unique URL and connect this to your web form where data postbacks are supported.

2. **Google Sheets Node:** Add a Google Sheets node set to "Append Spreadsheet Row" to add incoming data.

3. **Data Mapping:** Map the data fields from the form submission to the corresponding columns in Google Sheets.

4. **Execution Test:** Submit a test entry through your web form to ensure data flows correctly.

This workflow ensures every form submission is instantly captured into your CRM or preferred spreadsheet, streamlining lead management.

## 2. Sending Welcome Emails

**Goal:** Send an automatic welcome email to new subscribers or leads.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Trigger Node:** Connect an Email Read IMAP or Webhook node to start the process when new data (new lead) arrives.

2. **SMTP Node:** Add an SMTP node configured with your email service provider settings to send emails.

3. **Email Configuration:** Customize your email template in the SMTP node for welcome messaging.

4. **Execution Test:** Run a few tests with your own email to ensure welcome emails are delivered correctly.

This setup enables you to nurture new leads immediately by delivering personalized welcome emails as soon as they are registered.

## 3. Sending Notifications in Slack or Telegram

**Goal:** Notify your team in real-time about new leads or other updates through Slack or Telegram.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Trigger Node:** Use a Webhook or other data trigger suitable for your setup.

2. **Slack Node/ Telegram Node:** Depending on your preference, add a Slack or Telegram node. For Slack, you'll need to authorize n8n with your workspace.

3. **Message Configuration:** Define the message, including dynamic content placeholders to personalize the notifications.

4. **Execution Test:** Test by triggering the workflow to see if alerts are sent to your chosen communication platform.

These notifications keep your team in sync with new developments and lead updates, enhancing responsiveness and efficiency.
